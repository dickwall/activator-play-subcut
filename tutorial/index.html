        Play with Dependency Injection and SubCut 
    </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank">Dependency injection</a> is a design
        pattern that frees your code from creational concerns, making your code cleaner and easier to test.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tutorial demonstrates dependency injection using SubCut and testing using Scalatest in
        a simple Play application.
        <a href="https://github.com/dickwall/subcut/blob/master/GettingStarted.md" target="_blank">SubCut</a>
        takes advantage of Scala's type system for dependency injection making it
        an easy, lightweight and type-safe way to inject your dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tutorial will take about 10 minutes to complete and assumes that you are already familiar with the basics
        of a Play application.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Injecting the Application
    </h2>
    <p>First, take a look at the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">Application</a> class. You should
        notice that a new parametric field has been added to the class, called
        <code>bindingModule</code> and of type <code>BindingModule</code>, it is also
        marked as <code>implicit</code> which means the Scala compiler can automatically
        fill it in if a <code>BindingModule</code> type is required by some other method
        or new class instance.
    </p>
    <p>The class has also had the Injectable trait added to it, this allows configured bound instances to
    be automatically injected upon creation of a new instance of the class. The line 
    <pre><code>val textGenerator = inject[TextGenerator]</code></pre> achieves this, but you can already make an improvement to this code.
    This form of injection will fail if no TextInjector has been configured in the bindings you are using,
    but if you change the injection to:
    <pre><code>injectOptional[TextGenerator] getOrElse new WelcomeTextGenerator</code></pre>
    instead, then SubCut will use the configured TextGenerator if bound, or fall back on the default
    WelcomeTextGenerator if not. 
    </p>
    <p>This is safer at runtime and also makes it easy to see what the "standard"
    definition for the TextGenerator is in normal usage, rather than having to dig through configuration files
    to see what is used in the typical case.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
       TextGenerator
    </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">TextGenerator</a> 
        is an abstract class and we have a concrete implementation of it in the form of
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">WelcomeTextGenerator</a>
        which is our standard implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        TextGenerator is a rudimentary service that simply generates text. You'll have more useful
        services in your code e.g. a repository service that is backed by a concrete class to communicate with a
        database. By using dependency injection we can configure the type of service required outside of the class that
        needs to call on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make things a little bit more interesting, we have an embedded dependency inside of WelcomeTextGenerator
        called <code>welcomeText</code> of type <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">Greeting</a>.
        This requires WelcomeTextGenerator to also be injectable, which means it also needs the implicit bindingModule defined.
        Then the Greeting instance configured is injected as well. This injection already uses the safer injectOptional form
        so that if a configured binding cannot be found at runtime, it will use the default instead. It then gets the value from
        inside that Greeting as the String to welcome people to the site.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Bindings and Configuration
    </h2>
    <p>
        The configuration for the injected items is defined in the
        <a href="#code/app/config/StandardBindings.scala" class="shortcut">StandardBindings</a> object which
        extends <code>NewBindingModule</code>. Within the constructor code (which is actually a function of MutableBindingModule
        to Unit), bindings are made using a simple DSL. When the function has been used by the constructor
        the Mutability is removed, so the resulting BindingModule is immutable (and thread safe).
    </p>
    <p>
        The line <code>import module._</code> makes it more convenient to make the bindings as you are able to say
        <code>bind [Type] ...</code> instead of <code>module.bind [Type] ...</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first binding provides a single instance that will always be used when a Greeting is required. Greeting
        is a simple leaf class (i.e. not injected itself) so we just make a new Greeting and bind it to the Greeting
        type. Note that it is perfectly valid to bind a type to an instance of the same type, it does not have to be
        a subtype (so you can bind any instance of a class to the type of that class if it makes sense).
    </p>
    <p>
        The second binding is for <code>TextGenerator</code> and provides a <code>WelcomeTextGenerator</code> instance.
        <code>WelcomeTextGenerator</code> is itself injected, so we need to carry the binding module through to it as well.
        Because modules can be updated (they are immutable, but can be copied and updated to new bindings in the copying
        resulting in a new immutable binding module but with a different configuration) we use the <code>toModuleSingle</code>
        binding, which makes the current module (whatever it is) available to the class you are creating. It is marked
        implicit so that the call to new will pick up the binding module automatically, but you could also remove the
        implicit module and use placeholder syntax to pass the module through to the new instance explicitly. Give it
        a go by replacing that binding line with the following code:
        <pre><code>bind [TextGenerator] toModuleSingle { new WelcomeTextGenerator()(_) }</code></pre> and save the file to
        test that everything still works.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Testing with SubCut and ScalaTest
    </h2>
    <p>
        Now take a look at <a href="#code/test/controllers/ApplicationTest.scala" class="shortcut">ApplicationTest</a>.
        In this test, we are going to use a mock to verify that a request for the welcome page to the Application
        does invoke the welcomeText method on the TextGenerator. In order to do this we create a mock TextGenerator 
        instance and then bind it in for the TextGenerator for the purposes of the test.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>StandardBindings.modifyBindings { implicit module =></code> takes the StandardBindings we have for
        the project and provides you with a copy of the bindings that you can modify. This lets you re-bind
        some of the types to provide alternative implementations than the standard ones. In this case we
        bind the mocked textGenerator instance in for TextGenerator so that it will use our mock instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Creating the Application instance with new now uses our modified test bindings, and when we make
        a fake page request, it calls through to the TextGenerator which uses the mock. At the end of the
        test we verify that welcomeText was called in the mock.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modifying SubCut bindings in tests is completely thread-safe, each modification gets its own copy
        of the bindings so they do not interfere with one another. This means all tests can be run in parallel,
        mocking out different parts of the system or just re-configuring bindings for that test, and it will
        not affect any of the other tests running at the same time.
    </p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Integrating with Play
    </h2>
    <p>
      The final part to using SubCut with Play is to integrate the injection into the play lifecycle. Since
      the <code>Application</code> class is now injected and takes a bindingModule as a constructor parameter
      we will need to provide that bindingModule when play gets a new Controller instance (e.g. Application).
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at <a href="#code/app/Global.scala" class="shortcut">Global</a> to see how this is accomplished.
      The standard implementation of GlobalSettings in play uses reflection to create an instance of a new
      controller class, but only works if the Controller has a default (no-parameter) constructor. We need
      to override the implementation of the <code>getControllerInstance</code> method and add the ability
      to fill in the StandardBindings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The least invasive way to do this is to attempt to create the instance with the default constructor
      first (some of our controllers may not be injected and will still have a default constructor) and
      if that fails, try and use the constructor that takes a <code>BindingModule</code> instead. This is
      what the code you see here does - if the newInstance for a default constructor fails with a
      <code>ReflectionException</code> then try and look up the BindingModule constructor - if it is there
      we can use it, and if not we get the same kind of ReflectionException we would have got before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have the constructor we can pass in the StandardBindings (which will be the configuration we
      use for production) to the new instance. This is then implicitly passed down to all children of that
      class if needed, and to their children, and so on. This is the Scala feature that SubCut uses to
      pass the configuration down to any class that needs it - you just have to make sure that there is
      an unbroken chain of the implicit BindingModule parameter down to the classes that need them, and
      the Scala compiler helps with that.
